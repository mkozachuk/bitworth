# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Hard Rules

- Error shape: always use `{ error: { code: string, message: string, context?: unknown } }`, never `{ error: string }`
- `react-compiler` → error (enforced in all React components)
- `astro/no-set-html-directive` → error
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` → error, prefix unused with `_`

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Start dev server (Astro)
- `npm run build` — Production build
- `npm run preview` — Preview production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` — ESLint with auto-fix
- `npm run format` — Prettier write
- `npx astro sync` — Generate Supabase types

## Auth Flow

Protected routes are defined in `src/middleware.ts` (`PROTECTED_ROUTES`). All auth logic lives in:
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` — Supabase client factory
- `src/pages/api/auth/` — Server API routes (signin, signup, signout)
- `src/pages/auth/` — Auth pages (signin, signup, confirm-email)

Unauthenticated requests to protected routes redirect to `/auth/signin`.

## Environment Setup

- Required vars: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`
- **Local dev**: `.env` — local Supabase (run `supabase start` via Docker first); also copy `.env.example` to `.dev.vars` for Wrangler
- **Production**: two-step setup required for Cloudflare Workers Builds auto-deploy:
  1. Runtime secrets: `wrangler secret put SUPABASE_URL --name bitworth` + `wrangler secret put SUPABASE_KEY --name bitworth`
  2. Build env vars: set the same vars in Cloudflare dashboard under `Settings → Environment Variables` (Workers Builds pipeline reads these, not runtime secrets)
- Both `.env` and `.dev.vars` are gitignored — never commit credentials

## Pre-commit Hooks

Husky runs `lint-staged` before every commit:
- `*.{ts,tsx,astro}` → `eslint --fix`
- `*.{json,css,md}` → `prettier --write`

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Astro v6 with SSR + React v19 islands
- **Language**: TypeScript v5 (strict)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite`
- **Auth**: Supabase SSR (`@supabase/ssr`)
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Workers (via `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter + Wrangler)

## Code Style

- **2-space indentation** in TypeScript (Prettier `tabWidth: 2`)
- **Print width**: 120 chars
- `no-console` → warn
- `astro/prefer-class-list-directive` → warn

## MCP Servers

- **Context7** (`mcp__context7__*`): Fetch current library/framework docs. Always use `resolve-library-id` first, then `query-docs`. Prefer over web search for API syntax, configuration, and version migration.
- **Exa** (`mcp__exa__*`): Web search and fetch for current information, news, facts, and external URLs. Use for anything requiring up-to-date web data beyond library docs.
- **Linear** (`mcp__linear-server__*`): Manage Linear issues, projects, documents, and cycles directly from the CLI.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 5

Scale the single-change cycle into parallel work with **worktrees, goal-directed delegation, and multi-session orchestration**:

```
worktree per change -> /goal or claude -p -> PR -> review -> merge
```

The lesson focus is safe throughput: isolated contexts, choosing the right execution mode, and capping parallelism at review capacity.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Code isolation** | |
| `git worktree add` | You need a separate working directory for a parallel change. One change per worktree, one fresh agent context per worktree. |
| **Complex changes** | |
| `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | The change has multiple phases, needs manual gates, or benefits from interactive decision-making during execution. |
| **Simple changes** | |
| `/goal` | You have a clear, bounded task and want goal-directed delegation. The agent works autonomously toward the stated goal with a stop condition. |
| `claude -p` | You want headless execution for a well-defined task. The Ralph Wiggum loop (run, check, retry) is the universal autonomous pattern. |
| **Multi-session orchestration** | |
| Superset / Conductor / Antigravity / VS Code Agent View | You are running multiple agent sessions in parallel and need visibility, coordination, or session management across them. |

### Parallel work rules

- One change per worktree or isolated workspace. One fresh agent context per change.
- Choose interactive `/10x-implement` for complex changes, `/goal` or `claude -p` for simple ones.
- Parallelism is capped by review capacity. More agents without review means more unreviewed code, not higher throughput.
- The quality pain from faster shipping is intentional — it bridges into Module 3 testing gates.

### Lesson boundaries

- Do not reteach interactive `/10x-implement` or `/10x-impl-review`; those are Lessons 2 and 3.
- Do not introduce testing strategy here. The quality pain is the motivation for Module 3.
- Worktrees are a mechanism for isolation, not the topic of a full git tutorial.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/` - active change folder
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - implementation input for any execution mode

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
